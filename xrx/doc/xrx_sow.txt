Proposed research topics for XRX collaboration 2015 

(Numbers are multiples of FTE)
1. Demonstrate printer interoperability with XRX specified file formats (0.05)
2. Identify feasible color specification options (patterns, textures,..?) and implement color mapping on solid model (0.3)
3. Optimize part printing orientation for support structure (volume and accessibility) (0.4)
4. Estimate printing and post-processing time and cost for a chosen build orientation (0.1)
4. Develop material properties ('optical pancakes') model for color ink (0.4)
5. Extend build orientation optimization algorithm & time+cost evaluation to include material properties (0.05)
6. For multiple parts, identify optimal packing by choosing best fit for individually optimal build orientation (0.3)
7. Develop planning and scheduling system for multiple parts over multiple printers (plantrol or printcise?) (0.4)
8. Develop front end for user-interaction, debug, and visualization for XRX (0.2)

Total = 2.2 FTE
